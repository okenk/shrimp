I got a little confused and talked to Christine. She thought the model basically sounded like a stock assessment and thought I should just use SS. I wonder if I am missing something or didn't communicate what data we have? The growth part is easy, but I'm not sure how to integrate it into the abundance part. Is there a paper or book that describes the type of model you are thinking of?


## Data:
Data we have at month-year-fishing area resolution:

* Average length and sample size for each age class (1-3) if it was sampled
* SD for each age class from 2014-2018
* Total catch in lbs
* Count per pound
* Percent age composition of the catch by number
* All of this for 1989-1995, 2014-2018, working on getting more years, a lot of pubs seems to have 1980-present

## Biological model:
$L_{a,y,m}$ is length of age $a$ shrimp in month $m$ of year $y$. Then

$$\begin{aligned}
L_{1,y,1} &= \alpha_0 + \epsilon_{1,y,1} \\
L_{a,y,m} &= \alpha_1 + L_{a,y,m-1} + \epsilon_{a,y,m} \\
L_{a,y,1} &= \alpha_2 + L_{a-1, y-1, m_{\max}} + \epsilon_{a,y,1}
\end{aligned}$$

$\alpha_0$ is average size at recruitment to the fishery, $\alpha_1$ is the monthly within fishing season growth increment, and $\alpha_2$ is the across fishing season growth increment. Right now I assume $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$, though I don't think that is correct as there is not much wintertime growth. I tried to estimate $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ that get multiplied by length (i.e., mean reverting AR process instead of random walk), but $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were so tightly correlated it seemed pointless. (Could add it back in.) All of these can be functions of environmental variables. There is also an existing theory that growth is density-dependent, so they grow less when there are more shrimp around. The process variability $\epsilon$ follows a normal distribution. 

## Observation model:

$$\bar{L}_{a,y,m,area} \sim N\left(L_{a,y,m}, \frac{\sigma_\text{obs}}{\sqrt{n_{a,y,m,area}}} \right) $$

where $\bar{L}_{a,y,m,area}$ is the empirical mean length for age $a$ in month $m$ of year $y$ sampled in area $area$, $\sigma_\text{obs}$ is the observation standard deviation, and $n_{a,y,m,area}$ is the number of age $a$ shrimp that were sampled from the catch in month $m$ of year $y$ in area $area$. 

## Fitting:

The model is fit in stan as a multivariate auto-regressive state-space model. Each year class is a different state process and each area represents a different observation process of the same length "state." There is some evidence that a few areas have consistently small shrimp-- I could potentially make some of the parameters hierarchical to incorporate this.

Martell et al. 2000 report annual M of 0.96 $\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is used in VPA.
